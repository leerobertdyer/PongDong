# Pong
A simple pong remake, two player online


FEATURES TO ADD:
1. Multiplayer functionality
2. Single player mode would be sick! Not even sure how to go about that.
3. Would like the ball to increase slightly in speed whenever it is hit by a paddle
4. Would be nice to be able to move the paddle both forward and back as well as side to side
5. An ability to adjust starting speed of ball
6. An ability to adjust speed of paddle motion
7. A count-in sequence to start the game
8. An end to the game (set points to win at 10, skunk at 7 to 0, etc...)
9. Flashing Ball
10. "Brick Wall" that you have to break through behind paddle (like javanoid) in order to score.


KNOWN ISSUES:

1. Ball problems:
   -When the ball hits just right it gets stuck in the paddle
