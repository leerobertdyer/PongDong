# PONGDONG

Update 1.5.0 _made up version number, but we can go with it for next time..._

I updated the game to include Blocks class that is a barrier to scoring;

Added functionality to make them disappear when struck by the ball.
Added a short timer video to count down the game and used a setInterval function
to ensure game started after video;

### Game Start

We could use the same video timer for a pause button...

- Set this up for space bar activation

Still need p1 logs on and recieves 'waiting for second player' message

## Other Functionality:

**Single Player Mode!**
> Will work on a single player option. Will involve
> updating the game start so that it doesn't assume two player and
> adding algorythms for the computer to "follow" the ball trajectory.

**Power Ups!**
Little floating bubbles that pop out at random and then:

- slow or speed up ball,
- make paddles larger/smaller
- blast through barriers
- give double points
